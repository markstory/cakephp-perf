# CakePHP Perf

A very basic peformance suite to compare the various versions of CakePHP on a number of basic tasks:

* Hello World Page.
* A list of 20 records out of a SQLite database.
* A very simple add record form.

Each directory contains a similar application. You can test the applications using make:

```
make test VERSION=3-0
```

The make script assumes you are running the harness at `localhost/cakephp-perf/`.

# Requirements

* PHP 5.4.19+
* Make
